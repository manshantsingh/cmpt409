\section{City Slickers}

\section{Linking Logos}
Kinda solution?

Partitions of n not hard to form. Create a bitmask of possible sums, with 1 where a break between two blocks would be. AND to see if there would be a disconnect. (needs pruning for time)

\section{Longshot}
Crappy solution, mostly done

\section{Prefix Goodness}
Suffix arrays. Ew. number of strings n is very large.

\section{Quantum Teleporters}

\section{Tennis Probability}
Completely Done

\section{Zurch Trees}
Divide and conquer or something. Basically, the strategy is to leave an officer at stars and have an officer search the connected nodes. If this strategy is optimal, we just need some way of counting 'star depth'
